            under Prof. Yehuda Ben-Zion in the Department of Earth Science at
            the University of Southern California. Malcolm's current work
            focuses on the structure of active fault zones in Southern
            California, and he gets excited about developing and applying new
            algorithms to this end. Malcolm lives in Medford, Massachusetts
            with his wife Sara and daughter Anastasia.

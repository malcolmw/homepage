    <h2>Academic biography</h2>
        <p>
            Malcolm White is a Postdoctoral Associate studying seismology
            with
            <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/people/nnakata">Dr. Nori Nakata</a>
            in the
            <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/">Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences</a>
            at the
            <a href="http://mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>
            in Cambridge, MA. Malcolm is also an Adjunct Professor of Statistcs
            at
            <a href="https://www.sattlercollege.org/">Sattler College</a>
            in Boston, MA. Malcolm's active research focuses
            on developing and applying computational techniques to observe
            seismogenic processes ranging from hydraulic-fracturing induced
            microseismicity to seismotectonic processes in major fault zones.
            Malcolm lives in Medford, MA with his wife Sara and daughter
            Anastasia.

            Malcolm earned a BSc in Computational Geophysics from
            <a href="https://carleton.ca/">Carleton University</a>
            (Ottawa, Canada) in 2013, following which he started
            working as a Seismic Analyst at the
            <a href="https://scripps.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography</a>
            (University of California, San Diego).  In 2016 he moved to the
            <a href="https://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>
            to start his PhD in Geological Sciences with
            <a href="https://earth.usc.edu/~ybz/">Prof. Yehuda Ben-Zion</a>.
            Malcolm received his PhD in August 2021, and subsequently began
            research at MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate and teaching at Sattler
            College as an Adjunct Professor.
